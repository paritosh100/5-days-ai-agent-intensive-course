# Day 1 · 5-Day AI Course

Kick off the course by exploring the practical workflows behind building AI-powered solutions. This folder is your sandbox for Day 1: use it to follow along with the lesson, run experiments, and capture insights.

## What's Inside

- `day-1a-from-prompt-to-action.ipynb` — Guided walkthrough of prompt design, tool use, and transforming ideas into runnable code.
- `day-1b-agent-architectures.ipynb` — Survey of agent patterns, orchestration strategies, and design trade-offs.
- Day 1 white paper — Conceptual overview, key frameworks, and background reading for the exercises.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or newer installed locally.
- (Recommended) A virtual environment so your dependencies stay isolated.
- The packages listed in each notebook’s first code cell.

## Quick Start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - `python -m venv .venv`
   - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install notebook requirements as you encounter them (e.g., `pip install <package>`).
3. Launch Jupyter with `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open each notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Working in the Notebooks

- Execute cells in order; later steps rely on earlier outputs.
- Read the markdown guidance for context, rationale, and expected observations.
- Duplicate a notebook before heavy experimentation so you retain a pristine reference copy.

## Staying Organized

- Capture prompts, parameter tweaks, and outcomes in your notes to compare approaches.
- Commit progress regularly with Git once you reach a stable checkpoint.
- If something breaks, revisit nearby markdown explanations or consult the course Slack/forum for support.
